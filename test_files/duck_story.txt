On the edge of a quiet lake, surrounded by whispering reeds, lived a duck named Oliver. Every morning, as the mist lifted from the water, Oliver would watch the swans glide by — tall, elegant, and impossibly graceful. He admired how they moved as if the lake itself obeyed them. But what Oliver loved most wasn’t their beauty — it was the sky reflected in their eyes.
Oliver dreamed of flying higher than any duck before him. The others laughed when he told them.
“Stay close to the water,” said old Mallory the drake. “The sky belongs to eagles, not to us.”
But Oliver didn’t listen. Each night, under the pale silver of the moon, he practiced flapping his wings. Higher. Longer. Harder.
One windy afternoon, a storm rolled over the lake. The sky turned gray and heavy, and the wind howled through the reeds. The other ducks hid, but Oliver stood on the shore, his feathers rippling. This was his moment. He took a deep breath and ran toward the water, wings beating furiously. The storm lifted him — higher, higher — until the lake below was a blur of silver and green.
For the first time, Oliver saw beyond the hills that framed his home. He saw rivers that glittered like glass, forests stretching endlessly, and a rainbow breaking through the clouds. The wind roared in his ears, and he laughed, wild and free.
When he finally returned to the lake, exhausted but shining with joy, the others stared in awe.
“You flew through the storm,” whispered Mallory.
Oliver smiled, shaking water from his wings. “No,” he said softly. “The storm flew with me.”
From that day on, whenever young ducklings asked about the sky, the old ducks would tell them about Oliver — the duck who didn’t fear the wind, because he had learned it was made for wings.
